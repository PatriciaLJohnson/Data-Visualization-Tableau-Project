# Data-Visualization-Tableau-Project
In this project, I created data visualizations to reveal insights from Kaggle’s US Census Demographic dataset. Using Tableau, I designed seven visualizations that tell a story and highlight patterns by exploring a series of analytical questions.

The Tableau worksheets and dashboards demonstrate the application of key data visualization concepts, including visual encoding, design principles, and effective communication to convey meaningful insights.

Project Overview
The goal of this project was to analyze the US Census Demographic dataset to uncover trends and patterns related to population, income, education, and other demographic factors. The visualizations were designed to provide clear, impactful storytelling through data.
